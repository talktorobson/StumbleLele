# REVISED Plan: Gemini Live Integration for Vercel

## Critical Issue: Vercel Does NOT Support WebSockets

Vercel's serverless functions are stateless and cannot maintain persistent WebSocket connections. This means the current `useGeminiLive` hook with WebSocket implementation **will not work in production on Vercel**.

## New Approach: Server-Side Gemini API with Streaming

Since WebSockets won't work on Vercel, we need to use Gemini's REST API with server-side streaming responses instead of the WebSocket-based Live API.

## Revised Implementation Plan

### Option 1: Use Existing Gemini REST API (RECOMMENDED)
Keep the current architecture but optimize it:

1. **Keep the `/api/chat` endpoint** - It already works on Vercel
2. **Add streaming support** to the chat endpoint for better UX
3. **Add voice-to-text** using browser's Web Speech API
4. **Add text-to-speech** using browser's Speech Synthesis API
5. **Remove** the non-functional WebSocket implementation

### Option 2: Use Third-Party Service
Integrate a Vercel-compatible real-time service:
- Pusher Channels (recommended by Vercel)
- Ably
- PubNub

But this adds complexity and cost.

## Simplified Implementation Steps (Option 1)

### Step 1: Clean Up Non-Working Code
**File**: `client/src/hooks/use-gemini-live.ts`
- Remove this file entirely (WebSockets won't work on Vercel)

**File**: `client/src/components/gemini-live-voice.tsx`
- Remove this component (it relies on WebSockets)

### Step 2: Enhance Current Chat with Voice
**File**: `client/src/components/chat.tsx`
- Add browser-based speech recognition for voice input
- Add browser-based speech synthesis for voice output
- Use existing `/api/chat` endpoint (already works!)

### Step 3: Add Streaming to API
**File**: `api/index.ts`
- Modify chat endpoint to support streaming responses
- Keep existing Gemini REST API integration

### Step 4: Browser-Based Voice Features
```typescript
// Voice Input (Speech Recognition)
const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.lang = 'pt-BR';
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  // Send to /api/chat
};

// Voice Output (Speech Synthesis)
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(response);
utterance.lang = 'pt-BR';
speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
```

## What This Achieves
1. ✅ Works on Vercel (no WebSockets needed)
2. ✅ Real voice input/output (using browser APIs)
3. ✅ Real AI responses (using Gemini REST API)
4. ✅ Simple implementation
5. ✅ No third-party services needed

## What We Lose
- ❌ True real-time streaming audio (would need custom server)
- ❌ Server-side voice processing (browser-based instead)

## Testing on Vercel
```bash
# Build locally with Vercel CLI
vercel build

# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Test voice features in deployed environment
```

## Conclusion
The original plan to use Gemini Live WebSocket API is not compatible with Vercel's serverless architecture. Instead, we should enhance the existing working solution with browser-based voice capabilities.
