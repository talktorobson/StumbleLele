2. Add game type to storage schema
3. Implement game logic and scoring
4. Update progress tracking
5. Add AI suggestions for the game

### Modifying Avatar Expressions
1. Edit `client/src/components/lele-avatar.tsx`
2. Update SVG paths for new expressions
3. Add emotion mappings in `useAvatar` hook
4. Test with different emotional states

### Adding New Chat Features
1. Update `api/[...route].ts` with new endpoints
2. Modify AI prompt in `api/lib/ai.ts`
3. Add UI components in `client/src/components/chat.tsx`
4. Update conversation storage logic

### Adding New AI Provider
1. Install AI provider SDK in package.json
2. Add client initialization in `api/lib/ai.ts`
3. Extend `AIModel` type to include new provider
4. Add API call logic in `generateResponse` method
5. Update UI selector in `client/src/components/ai-model-selector.tsx`
6. Add environment variable and documentation

## Important Notes

### Security
