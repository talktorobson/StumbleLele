- Enhanced error handling for flag state management

- Added specific humor techniques (trocadilhos, situações absurdas)
- Provided examples of Brazilian kid humor that works
- Emphasized wordplay and unexpected twists
- **Result**: Much funnier, culturally relevant jokes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Flag Mechanism (Ba-dum-tss Fix)
```typescript
// Before: Flag reset in async callback (unreliable)
setTimeout(async () => {
  await playBaDumTssSound();
  isJokeRequestRef.current = false; // Could fail
}, 500);

// After: Flag reset in finally block (reliable)
setTimeout(async () => {
  try {
    await playBaDumTssSound();
  } catch (error) {
    addLog(`❌ Failed to play ba-dum-tss sound: ${error}`);
  } finally {
    isJokeRequestRef.current = false; // Always resets
    addLog('🎭 Joke request flag reset');
  }
}, 500);
```

### Anti-Emoji Rules
```typescript
// System instructions updated with:
- "NUNCA use emojis ou símbolos"
- "PROIBIDO usar emojis, símbolos ou descrições visuais"
- "Fala fluida NUNCA use emojis ou símbolos"
```

### Enhanced Joke Prompts
```typescript
// Added humor techniques:
- "Trocadilhos com nomes de comidas brasileiras"
- "Situações absurdas com animais domésticos"
- "Perguntas e respostas com reviravolta inesperada"
- "NUNCA use finais repetitivos como 'hihihi' ou 'hahaha'"
- "Cada piada deve ter seu próprio final criativo e único"
```
